Iowa State University Computer Science 228 Homework labs in C++

This is a troll repository for CS or Computer Engineering students who want to cheat on their homework labs in 228. The class is almost guarenteed to reuse at least one of these programs for the following years. That's why I have created this work of art. 

I am converting the original Java code I write for the classes labs to the superior, to me, C++ code. This means that the programs will only look the same on the surfaces, not even. This code will also likely use more C or C++ specific utilities, so any students who actually read this code and don't copy it will realize their mistake. This code is open to any students who want to use it as a reference for what they should do, but DON'T copy my code. It WON'T work any way.

Programs will be tested for memory leeks and leaks, maybe even lakes. 

Feel free to test out the code to get an idea for how the program should operate, as well. I mostly like won't be commenting this code very much, so this is probably the most useful thing for students to do anyway. 

I used the GNU C Compiler `gcc` or `g++` and `valgrind` to test for memory leaks.
